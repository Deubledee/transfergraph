transfergraph
=============

Quick and dirty tool to graph transfer functions.

Just a little thing I built to help me visualize what my Waveshapers are doing in some Web Audio projects I'm working on.

And yes, I'm eval-ing the input. So go ahead and try a transfer function of `alert('PWNED)` and just get it out of your system.
